## About

This is my revised code of the tutorial at:
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/calculate-feature-importance-with-python/
- https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-real-and-categorical-data/

## Setup

go to the tutorial folder and do the following:

```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Then, you can use `jupyter notebook` or use VSCode `code .` to open the notebooks.
